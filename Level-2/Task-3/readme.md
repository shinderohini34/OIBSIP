# To-Do App

Todo Lists are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list of everything that we have to do. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed. 

The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:

- Add tasks
- Update tasks
- Read tasks
- Delete tasks
